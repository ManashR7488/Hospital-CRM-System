Problem Statement 8: AI-Enabled CRM System with Automated AI Calling
Description:
Organizations across education, retail, and service sectors rely heavily on customer relationship
management (CRM) systems to maintain engagement with clients, students, and partners.
However, traditional CRM tools require significant manual intervention for follow-ups, lead nurturing,
and feedback collection — resulting in delays, inconsistent communication, and limited
personalization.
The next generation of CRM should not only automate data handling but also communicate
intelligently. By leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Speech
Synthesis, such a system can autonomously call, interact, and respond to customers in natural
language, enhancing both efficiency and experience.
Challenge:
Develop an AI-Enabled CRM System that seamlessly manages customer interactions, automates
communication, and enables AI-driven voice calling as a plugin feature.
The system should:
• Maintain a centralized database of clients, leads, and interactions.
• Integrate AI-based calling agents capable of making outbound calls to share information,
confirm appointments, or collect feedback using natural voice.
• Allow users to configure call scripts dynamically (text-to-speech, multilingual, emotionaware).
• Generate call summaries and actionable insights using speech-to-text analytics and
sentiment detection.
• Support multi-channel engagement (calls, SMS, WhatsApp, and email) through unified
dashboards.
• Provide real-time analytics on communication performance, lead conversion, and customer
satisfaction.
• Include role-based dashboards for admins, agents, and management for better workflow
management.
Expected Outcome:
• A functional prototype of an AI-integrated CRM capable of initiating and managing voicebased interactions autonomously.
• Increased productivity by reducing manual calling tasks.
• Data-driven insights on engagement patterns and customer sentiment.
• Scalable, modular CRM system adaptable for educational institutions, businesses, or
government service platforms.
• Enhanced user experience with intelligent automation and natural language communication.
Technical Feasibility:
• AI/ML Models: Use NLP and speech synthesis models (e.g., OpenAI GPT API, Google
Dialogflow, or AWS Polly or any free models) for human-like AI conversations.
• Speech Recognition: Integrate ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) tools like Whisper or
Google Speech-to-Text or free tools for transcribing call responses.
• Telephony Integration: Connect VoIP, Twilio APIs or free tools for automated outbound
calling.
• CRM Framework: Build using Node.js / Django backend with React / Vue front-end or
integrate with existing CRMs via API.
• Database & Analytics: Use local or cloud-based databases (PostgreSQL, MongoDB) with
dashboards.
• Security: Ensure data encryption, consent-based communication, and GDPR/DPDP
compliance.
